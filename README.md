# Collaborative-Brick-Laying-Robot

In an innovative approach to streamline construction processes, our team has developed the Collaborative Brick Laying Robot, a sophisticated Cartesian robot designed to enhance efficiency and precision in brick laying. This two-degree-of-freedom robot operates in the Y and Z directions, providing a high level of control over the brick-laying process. By integrating a camera system with MATLAB GUIDE, operators can remotely position and place bricks with real-time visual feedback. This remote operation capability not only increases safety by reducing the need for human presence on-site but also allows for higher accuracy and consistency in brick placement.

The core of our project lies in the seamless integration of hardware and software components. Key hardware elements include a DC Geared Motor, Arduino, L298N Motor Driver, pulleys, a timing belt, and rails, all mounted on a robust frame that houses the brick rack. The MATLAB-based Human Machine Interface (HMI) provides a user-friendly platform for operators to control the robot, view live video feeds, and make real-time adjustments. The operator can easily adjust the robot's position based on the live feed, ensuring precise brick placement. This intuitive interface ensures that even operators with minimal training can effectively control the robot and execute precise brick-laying tasks.

Our Collaborative Brick Laying Robot exemplifies the future of construction automation, where remote operation and advanced robotics come together to improve productivity and safety. This project, developed under the guidance of Prof. Dattatray Sawant, showcases our commitment to leveraging technology for practical and impactful solutions. The collaborative effort and interdisciplinary approach have resulted in a cutting-edge tool that stands to revolutionize the brick-laying industry, offering a glimpse into the future of automatedÂ construction.
